# case_study_covid

In this repository we have stored several HTML figures that we obtained peforming the Covid Case Study using Edinburgh as a City. For doing this study, we used
[City_Case_Study_Edinburgh.ipynb notebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r3xNQZUbQmhuPdqYc2J5DktQRu-j-Qek/view)

Furthermore for displaying any of the HTML figures that we have in this repo, we just need to replace <FIGURE.HTML> in this link `https://rosafilgueira.github.io/case_study_covid/<FIGURE.HTML>' withe the figure that we want to display. For example [freq_performance_places_category_edinburgh_August](https://rosafilgueira.github.io/case_study_covid/freq_performance_places_category_edinburgh_August.html)
